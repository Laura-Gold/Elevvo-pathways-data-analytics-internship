**Task 3: Business Insights & Executive Report for E-Commerce Dataset (Kaggle)**

This folder contains all deliverables for Task 3 of the Elevvo Pathways Data Analytics Internship. The project is based on the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist (Kaggle) and demonstrates a full-cycle analytics workflow, from data preparation to reporting.

**Project Components**
1. Raw & Processed Data

Includes original datasets from Olist (where upload size permits)

Processed CSV files used directly for dashboard visualizations and insights

2. Data Preparation Script (olist_data.ipynb)

Used to clean, merge, and structure raw data

Outputs optimized CSVs for analysis and dashboard development

The full merged dataset was too large to upload; only relevant processed outputs are included

3. Dashboard Files

An interactive dashboard built using the cleaned CSV outputs

Visualizes trends across:

Orders & revenue

Customer behavior

Products & payments

Geographic insights and segmentation

4. Executive Summary (One-Pager, attached to dashboard)

A decision-focused summary highlighting:

Key findings

Business recommendations

Actionable insights for stakeholders

**Task Objectives Covered**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Segmentation & visualization

Business storytelling

Executive-level reporting

**Notes**

Only necessary outputs are included to keep the repository lightweight.

The dashboard and processed data were generated from the datasets in this folder using the provided .ipynb script.
