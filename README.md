# Data Analytics Portfolio: Superstore Performance Analysis

Welcome to my **Superstore Performance Analysis** project! This repository showcases a hands-on approach to exploring, cleaning, and visualizing sales data to extract meaningful business insights.

## Project Overview

In this project, I worked with the [Superstore Sales Dataset (Kaggle)] to practice and demonstrate core data analytics skills using **Excel**. The goal was to turn raw sales data into actionable insights for business decision-making.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Import & Cleaning**
   - Imported the sales dataset into Excel.
   - Organized and formatted data for easier analysis.
   - Used formulas to clean and validate data, ensuring accuracy.

2. **Data Analysis**
   - Created **pivot tables** to summarize key metrics:
     - Total revenue
     - Units sold
     - Monthly and yearly trends
   - Calculated **YoY (Year-over-Year)** and **MoM (Month-over-Month)** changes to track performance growth.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Designed clean, readable **charts** to highlight overall performance.
   - Added **slicers** to filter results by region, product category, and other dimensions.
   - Created Visualizations for interactive exploration of performance metrics.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data cleaning and organization in Excel  
- Pivot table creation and analysis  
- Calculating growth metrics (YoY, MoM)  
- Data visualization   
- Filtering and interactive exploration with slicers  

## Insights

This project helped me uncover sales trends across regions and product categories, identify top-performing products, and understand monthly/yearly revenue patternsâ€”showcasing the power of organized data and visual storytelling in business decision-making.
